# Smartlock-using-Facial-Recognition
## Abstract
The Smart Door Lock is a security system that is based on the facial recognition of visitors. It uses components such as Raspberry Pi, PIR motion sensor and Pi camera in order to detect any intruders. It is coupled with CV facilities (computer vision) which allows it to scan and confirm whether the person is an interloper or an associate who is known to the owner. Once this is complete, the system sends the appropriate message to the owner via a connected Discord server and either unlatches the door to allow the associate, or keeps the door bolted and raises an alarm to the user.

The Discord bot of the Smart Door Lock is responsible for communicating to the user the following actions- the opening of the door, the closing of the door, sending a ten seconds video of the view from the door to capture whoever is in front of it in case of emergencies and turning the facial recognition feature of the security system on or off. 
In this project we aim to design a Smart Door Lock to provide security to users and maximize the safety exclusively in the absence of the residents. Smart Door Lock connects IoT and CV concepts to form the foundation for its security system.
